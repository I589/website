## What is BYOC

[TBD]

"Self-hosted agent" mode is supported...

It really shines with creating VMs on demand.

## Why would you need it

* Re-use existing hardware or hardware with better performance
* Custom VM size (GPU, memory-, disk-, network-optimized)
* Custom software
* Security compliance requirements
* ...

## Benefits

Don't have to run 24x7 machine with the agent.
Clean environment on every build.
We manage build images for you!
